- 07372f1: fix: register event listeners after Vimeo player is loaded

  - Move event listener registration inside 'loaded' callback to ensure proper timing
  - Emit 'loaded' event immediately when already triggered
  - Register other events only after player is fully initialized
  - Prevents race condition where useVimeoEvent subscribes before player is ready
